    "# 4. Text data and preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the recent impressive advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have emerged in the field of natural language processing. In addition to simpler tasks such as sentiment analysis or text classification, there has been considerable progress in more advanced tasks such as translation and question answering. Text processing involves several unique techniques and methods, which we shall look at next.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bag-of-words approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In natural language processing tasks, the original data is typically in the form of strings, or a list of strings. Neural networks cannot process strings directly, so they need to be converted to arrays consisting of numerical values. This preprocessing usually consists of a succession of distinct steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Text standardization*: convert everything to lowercase, remove punctuation and other special characters, etc.\n",
    "* *Tokenization*: split the text into separate units or **tokens** (words, characters, N-grams ...), and set up a vocabulary\n",
    "* *Vectorization*: associate a numerical vector with each of the tokens in the vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate an example of implementing these methods, we use the well-known IMDB movie review dataset, that can be downloaded from [the Stanford page of Andrew Maas](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). The movie reviews are contained in two folders: one for training samples and one for testing. These folders contain additional subfolders \"pos\" and \"neg\" with samples corresponding to their sentiment; note that the train directory contains an extra subfolder \"unsup\", which is unnecessary for this purpose and should be removed before continuing.

Also the intercuts used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the real \\'white\\' Wellington, fail miserably.
